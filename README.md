# Voice Assistant Eliza by @qruty
## Overview 
Your personal voice assistant. Written in Python.

"Eliza" is a 100% open-source, modular voice assistant framework. We aim to do everything that Siri, Cortana, and Echo can do - and more.
In this project i used several important libs: Speech-Recognition (as an AI lib), pyttsx3, tkinter and others.

##Usage Examples:
Say "Athena" (wait for double beep) then...

"Play some music"
"Tweet [Hello world!]" (IFTTT key required)
"Define [artificial intelligence]"
"Show me pictures of [Taj Mahal]"
"Open facebook.com"
