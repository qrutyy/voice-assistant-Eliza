# Voice Assistant Eliza by @qruty
## Overview 
Your personal voice assistant. Written in Python.

"Eliza" is a 100% open-source, modular voice assistant framework. We aim to do everything that Siri, Cortana, and Echo can do - and more.
In this project i used several important libs: Speech-Recognition (as an AI lib), pyttsx3, tkinter and others.

## Usage Examples:
Start Eliza and say...

- "Play some music"
- "Lets play" 
- "Timer on 10 minutes"
- "Shutdown system"
- "Search Taj Mahal"
